Camera is one of the most cruicial and cost effective sensors in autonomous vehicles sensor stack. It provides high resolution information about the vehicle surrondings as well as road signs, traffic lights, and lane lines. 

One of the most straighforward approach to model the projection of a camera object from 3D space to a 2D space is using pinhole model.
